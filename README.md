This project explores the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health, focusing on how time spent on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter correlates with self-reported stress levels. Adolescents today are deeply integrated into the digital world, where social media shapes much of their social interaction and daily experiences. While these platforms offer meaningful opportunities for connection and self-expression, they also present potential risks—contributing to anxiety, depression, stress, and low self-esteem. This research leverages computational social science methods and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the impact of social media engagement on mental health. By examining social media activity and sentiment trends, the project aims to better understand how digital behaviors correspond with mental health outcomes, particularly stress, anxiety, and depression.

The central research question is: Is there a relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels among adolescents? This inquiry is motivated by the increased reliance on digital platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period that amplified social isolation and escalated digital engagement. As mental health concerns continue to grow among youth, researchers and practitioners are turning to computational tools to help identify digital markers of psychological distress. Understanding these patterns is essential for designing effective digital wellness strategies and early intervention systems.

The main goals of this project are to analyze the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health using data-driven and computational methods. The methodology includes several steps. First, we collect a dataset containing self-reported stress scores, hours spent on social media, and demographic information. Next, during data preprocessing, we clean the dataset by removing missing values and duplicates. We also encode categorical variables like gender into numerical values to facilitate analysis. In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we generate visualizations—such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps—to explore trends and relationships between the variables. For statistical analysis, we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient to assess the strength of the relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels. Additional statistical tests are used to analyze gender differences and other relevant subgroups.

To run this project, users should have Python 3.x installed (Python 3.7 or newer is recommended). All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. The project is structured into organized directories: the data/ folder contains the cleaned dataset (mental_health_analysis.csv), and the dataraw/ folder stores raw input data. The src/ directory contains Python scripts, including analysis.py for running statistical analysis, dataset.py for data loading and cleaning, and plots.py for creating visualizations. A Makefile is included for workflow automation. The repository also includes a README.md (this file), a requirements.txt listing dependencies, and a setup.cfg for configuration.

Before running the project, ensure that you have Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.7+) and the required Python libraries installed using the command pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the environment is set up, users can run the analysis scripts directly or adapt them within Jupyter Notebooks for exploration.

This repository is part of a final project presented using the UMD Fearlessly Forward template. The project is documented on GitHub and has been added to the project portfolio section of the contributor’s LinkedIn and résumé. The portfolio includes a final presentation recording, presentation slides, a written report, and this repository, making the full project accessible to researchers, educators, and employers.
