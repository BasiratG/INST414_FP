This project explores the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health, focusing on how time spent on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter correlates with self-reported stress levels. Adolescents today are deeply integrated into the digital world, where social media shapes much of their daily interaction and experiences. While these platforms provide meaningful opportunities for connection and self-expression, they also introduce risks that may contribute to anxiety, depression, stress, and reduced self-esteem. This project uses computational social science methods and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to examine how patterns in social media engagement relate to mental health outcomes, particularly stress, anxiety, and depression.

The central research question driving this project is: Is there a relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels among adolescents? This question is especially relevant given the increased reliance on digital platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic—a period marked by heightened online engagement and rising mental health concerns among youth. As researchers and practitioners continue to seek ways to identify early indicators of psychological distress, computational approaches can offer insights into digital behaviors that serve as potential markers of mental well-being. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective digital wellness strategies and early intervention systems.

The main goals of this project are to analyze the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health using data-driven and computational methods. The methodology includes several steps. First, a dataset containing self-reported stress scores, hours spent on social media, and demographic information is collected. During preprocessing, the dataset is cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates, and categorical variables—such as gender—are encoded into numerical values to support analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is then conducted using visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to explore trends and identify potential relationships between variables. For statistical analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient is used to assess the strength of the relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels. Additional statistical tests are conducted to compare demographic subgroups, including gender differences.

To run this project, users should have Python 3.x installed (Python 3.7 or newer is recommended). All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. The repository structure includes multiple organized directories: the data/ folder contains the cleaned dataset (mental_health_analysis.csv), while the dataraw/ folder stores the raw input data. The src/ directory contains all Python scripts, including analysis.py for statistical analysis, dataset.py for data loading and cleaning, and plots.py for visualization creation. A Makefile is included to support workflow automation. The repository also includes a README.md (this file), a requirements.txt for dependency installation, and a setup.cfg for configuration settings.

Before running the project, ensure that Python 3.x is installed and use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required libraries. Once the environment is set up, users can run the analysis scripts directly through the command line or adapt them within a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration.
