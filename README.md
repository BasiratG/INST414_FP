The Impact of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Mental Health: A Computational Approach
Project Overview:
The project explores the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health, focusing on how time spent on social media platforms correlates with stress levels. Adolescents are deeply integrated into the digital world, with platforms like Instagram, Tiktok, and Twitter shaping their social experiences and encounters. While these platforms provide significant opportunities for socialization, they also have the potential to contribute to mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, stress, and low self-esteem.
In this study, we aim to leverage computational social science and natural language processing(NLP) techniques to analyze the impact of social media usage on adolescent mental health. By examining social media activity and sentiment trends, this research will shed light on how digital behaviors relate to self-reported mental health symptoms, particularly focusing on stress, anxiety, and depression.
Research Question:
Is there a relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels among adolescents?
Context and Motivation:
In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased reliance on digital platforms for communication and entertainment, amplifying the concerns surrounding social media's effects on adolescent mental health. Researchers are exploring ways to track and predict mental health risks based on social media engagement. This research is vital for developing targeted digital wellness strategies, particularly in the context of increasing mental health concerns among adolescents.
Goals: 
The goals of this project are to analyze the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health using computational methods.
Methodology:
Data Collection: We will use a dataset containing self-reported stress scores, hours spent on social media, and other demographic information about adolescents.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates. The Gender column will be encoded numerically for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, will be created to explore trends in social media usage and stress levels.
Statistical Analysis: Pearson's correlation will be used to measure the relationship between time spent on social media and stress levels. Additional statistical tests may be performed to further analyze gender and other variables.
Setup and Usage:
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.7+)
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
